The AIRS and CrIS obslist functions tabulate lat, lon, time, and
sometimes zenith angles for all obs over a set of days and selected
scan pattern.  They take a latitude weighted subset and plot stats
both as histograms and as area weighted maps.  airs_obslist reads
the lat and lon fields from the airs granules, while cris_obslist
reads the ccast allgeo files

  airs_obslist - lat and lon bins for AIRS obs
  cris_obslist - lat and lon bins for CrIS obs

  plot_obsbin  - equal area obs counts and diffs
  plot_timebin - equal area time means and diffs
  plot_zenbin  - equal area secant means and diffs
  plot_lonbin  - equal area longitude means and difs
  ddiff_obs    - obs count double difference
  ddiff_time   - time double difference
  extend_time  - compare 16 and 32 day sequences

The AIRS and CrIS tbin functions take parameters year, day list,
cross track indices, frequency span, and (with in-line mods) ocean
or land subsets.  They read every granule over the requested span
and build tables of obs per Tb bin by day.

  airs_tbin  - tabulate AIRS Tb bins
  cris_tbin  - tabulate CrIS Tb bins
  airs_batch - batch driver for airs_tbin
  cris_batch - batch driver for cris_tbin
  plot_tbin  - compare AIRS and CrIS
  plot_airs  - multi-year AIRS stats
