obs_16day_source
-----------------
take a channel set, read every granule for the requested days,
build lists of selected obs, and then equal area maps from the
lists.  The batch scripts are set up to do multiple 16-day sets.
Scripts airs_bt_map, cris_bt_map, airs_obs_map, cris_obs_map all
loop on the 16-day sets and build maps, and airs_stat_map loops
on 16-day sets and builds a summary set for further processing.
The map_test scripts work from an earlier form of 16-day maps.
See README there for more info.

obs_quint_source
----------------
take parameters such as frequency, cross track index, and Tb sample
spans, read every granule for the requested days, and build lists of
selected obs.  Obs saved include Tb, lat, lon, time, solar zenith,
and satellite zenith.  Scripts are in obs_quint_source and data in
obs_quint_data.

  airs_obs_list  - build list of selected AIRS obs
  cris_obs_list  - build list of selected CrIS obs
  cris_obs_batch - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list
  airs_obs_batch - batch wrapper for airs_obs_list
  plot_obs_*     - assorted plot and test scripts
  uw_qc_*        - QC with UW omplex residual test

  obs_quint_data  - obs list data, mostly as quintiles

tbin tests
-----------
The tbin or PDF functions take parameters year, day list, cross
track indices, frequency span, and (with in-line mods) ocean or land
subsets.  They read every granule over the requested span and build
tables of obs per Tb bin by day.   Scripts are in tbin_source, data
in airs_pdfs, cris_pdfs, and pdf_test_*.

  airs_tbin   - tabulate AIRS Tb bins
  cris_tbin   - tabulate CrIS Tb bins
  airs_batch  - batch driver for airs_tbin
  cris_batch  - batch driver for cris_tbin
  plot_tbin   - compare AIRS and CrIS
  plot_airs   - multi-year basic AIRS PDF stats
  airs_pdfs   - multi-year AIRS moving-span PDFs

  pdf_test_*  - more recent tbin or PDF test data
  airs_pdfs   - AIRS tbin data for 2002-2017, to 340K
  cris_pdfs   - CrIS tbin data for 2015-2016, to 340K

geo tests
----------
See the README files in geo_source and geo_data

functions
-----------
  fixmyQC - QC from the ccast L1b_stat flags
  equal_area_bins - count and mean for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_map  - global map for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_spherical_bands - equal area latitude bands
  usgs_deg10_dem  - calculate land fraction

other scripts
--------------
  airs_fields - list most AIRS granule fields
