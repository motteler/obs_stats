obs_source
-----------
an "obs list" is a subset of AIRS or CrIS obs, typically a
latitude weighted subset of all obs for 16-days, for a small
subset of channels.  See obs_source/README for more info.

obs_quint_source
-----------------
earlier versions of obs list functions that work with quintiles
(73-day sets).  See obs_quint_src/README for more info.

recent data
-----------
obs_16day_airs_c* - 16-day AIRS rad obs lists and map stats
obs_16day_mix_v1 - 16-day AIRS & CrIS obs from LW window span
map_16day_mix_v1 - 16-day AIRS & CrIS maps from LW window span 
obs_quint_mix_v1 - quint AIRS & CrIS obs, LW & SW window span

tbin tests
-----------
The tbin or PDF functions take parameters year, day list, cross
track indices, frequency span, and (with in-line mods) ocean or land
subsets.  They read every granule over the requested span and build
tables of obs per Tb bin by day.   Scripts are in tbin_source, data
in airs_pdfs, cris_pdfs, and pdf_test_*.

  airs_tbin   - tabulate AIRS Tb bins
  cris_tbin   - tabulate CrIS Tb bins
  airs_batch  - batch driver for airs_tbin
  cris_batch  - batch driver for cris_tbin
  plot_tbin   - compare AIRS and CrIS
  plot_airs   - multi-year basic AIRS PDF stats
  airs_pdfs   - multi-year AIRS moving-span PDFs

  pdf_test_*  - more recent tbin or PDF test data
  airs_pdfs   - AIRS tbin data for 2002-2017, to 340K
  cris_pdfs   - CrIS tbin data for 2015-2016, to 340K

geo tests
----------
See the README files in geo_source and geo_data

functions
-----------
  fixmyQC - QC from the ccast L1b_stat flags
  equal_area_bins - count and mean for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_map  - global map for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_spherical_bands - equal area latitude bands
  usgs_deg10_dem  - calculate land fraction

other scripts
--------------
  airs_fields - list most AIRS granule fields
