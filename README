map tests
----------
The map test scripts take parameters such as year, days, cross track
index, frequency, and Tb range, read every granule for the requested
days, build lists of selected obs, and then equal area maps from the
lists.  The batch scripts are set up to do multiple 16 day maps.  The
map_test* scripts combine these 16-day sets in various ways.  Source
is in map_source and data in map_data.

  airs_map_list - equal area maps from selected AIRS obs
  cris_map_list - equal area maps from selected CrIS obs

  airs_map_batch - batch wrapper for airs_map_list
  n20_map_batch - batch wrapper for cris_map_list
  npp_map_batch - batch wrapper for cris_map_list

  map_test1 - combine equal area Tb maps, do AIRS and CrIS diff
  map_test2 - combine equal area Tb maps, do CrIS annual diffs
  map_test3 - combine equal area Tb maps, double difference
  map_test4 - combine equal area Tb maps, CrIS npp and n20 diffs

  map_data  - equal area map data, mostly as 16-day sets

obs list tests
---------------
The obs list tests take parameters such as year, days, cross track
index, and frequency and Tb sample spans, read every granule for the
requested days, and build lists of selected obs.  Obs saved include
Tb, lat, lon, time, solar zenith, and satellite zenith.  Scripts are
in obs_list_source, data in obs_list_data.

  airs_obs_list  - build list of selected AIRS obs
  cris_obs_list  - build list of selected CrIS obs
  cris_obs_batch - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list
  airs_obs_batch - batch wrapper for airs_obs_list
  plot_obs_*     - assorted plot and test scripts
  uw_qc_*        - QC with UW omplex residual test

  obs_list_data  - obs list data, mostly as quintiles

tbin tests
-----------
The tbin or PDF functions take parameters year, day list, cross
track indices, frequency span, and (with in-line mods) ocean or land
subsets.  They read every granule over the requested span and build
tables of obs per Tb bin by day.   Scripts are in tbin_source, data
in airs_pdfs, cris_pdfs, and pdf_test_*.

  airs_tbin   - tabulate AIRS Tb bins
  cris_tbin   - tabulate CrIS Tb bins
  airs_batch  - batch driver for airs_tbin
  cris_batch  - batch driver for cris_tbin
  plot_tbin   - compare AIRS and CrIS
  plot_airs   - multi-year basic AIRS PDF stats
  airs_pdfs   - multi-year AIRS moving-span PDFs

  pdf_test_*  - more recent tbin or PDF test data
  airs_pdfs   - AIRS tbin data for 2002-2017, to 340K
  cris_pdfs   - CrIS tbin data for 2015-2016, to 340K

geo tests
----------
See the README files in geo_source and geo_data

functions
-----------
  fixmyQC - QC from the ccast L1b_stat flags
  equal_area_bins - count and mean for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_map  - global map for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_spherical_bands - equal area latitude bands
  usgs_deg10_dem  - calculate land fraction

other scripts
--------------
  airs_fields - list most AIRS granule fields
