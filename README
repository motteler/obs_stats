obs list tests
---------------

These are similar to the PDF tests below.  They take parameters
such as year, days, cross track index, and frequency and Tb sample
spans, read every granule for the requested days, and build lists of
selected obs.  Obs saved include Tb, lat, lon, time, solar zenith,
and satellite zenith.

  obs_list_data  - obs list data, mostly as quintiles

  airs_obs_list  - build list of selected AIRS obs
  cris_obs_list  - build list of selected CrIS obs
  cris_obs_batch - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list
  airs_obs_batch - batch wrapper for airs_obs_list
  plot_hot_*     - assorted plot and test scripts
  uw_qc_*        - QC with UW omplex residual test

PDF tests
----------
The AIRS and CrIS tbin functions take parameters year, day list,
cross track indices, frequency span, and (with in-line mods) ocean
or land subsets.  They read every granule over the requested span
and build tables of obs per Tb bin by day.

  airs_tbin  - tabulate AIRS Tb bins
  cris_tbin  - tabulate CrIS Tb bins
  airs_batch - batch driver for airs_tbin
  cris_batch - batch driver for cris_tbin
  plot_tbin  - compare AIRS and CrIS
  plot_airs  - multi-year basic AIRS PDF stats
  airs_pdfs  - multi-year AIRS moving-span PDFs

geo tests
----------
See the README files in geo_test and geo_data

functions
-----------
  fixmyQC - QC from the ccast L1b_stat flags
  equal_area_bins - count and mean for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_map  - global map for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_spherical_bands - equal area latitude bands
  usgs_deg10_dem  - calculate land fraction

other scripts
--------------
  airs_fields - list most AIRS granule fields
