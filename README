The AIRS and CrIS obslist functions tabulate lat, lon, time, and
sometimes zenith angles for all obs over a set of days and selected
scan pattern.  They take a latitude weighted subset and plot stats
both as histograms and as area weighted maps.  airs_obslist reads
the lat and lon fields from the airs granules, while cris_obslist
reads the ccast allgeo files

  airs_obslist - lat and lon bins for AIRS obs
  cris_obslist - lat and lon bins for CrIS obs

  plot_obsbin  - equal area obs counts and diffs
  plot_timebin - equal area time means and diffs
  plot_zenbin  - equal area secant means and diffs
  plot_lonbin  - equal area longitude means and difs
  ddiff_obs    - obs count double difference
  ddiff_time   - time double difference
  extend_time  - compare 16 and 32 day sequences

The AIRS and CrIS tbin functions take a list of days, cross track
indices, and frequencies, and build a table of obs per temperature
bin.  These functions are relatively slow because they read all
granules over the time span.  The plot_tbin scripts plot comparison
results.  tbin_list.txt is a list of recent tests.

  airs_tbin  - AIRS Tb bins with optional lat and ocean subsetting
  cris_tbin  - CrIS Tb bins with optional lat and ocean subsetting
  plot_tbin  - comparison plots for airs_tbin and cris_tbin
  plot_tbin? - variations on the basic plot_tbin tests
