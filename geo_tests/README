The AIRS and CrIS geo list functions tabulate lat, lon, time, and
sometimes zenith angles for all obs over a set of days and selected
scan pattern.  They take a latitude weighted subset and plot stats
both as histograms and as area weighted maps.  airs_geo_list reads
the lat and lon fields from the airs granules, while cris_geo_list
reads the ccast allgeo files

  airs_geo_list - geo list and bins for AIRS obs
  cris_geo_list - geo list and bins for CrIS obs

  plot_geobin  - equal area obs counts and diffs
  plot_timebin - equal area time means and diffs
  plot_zenbin  - equal area secant means and diffs
  plot_lonbin  - equal area longitude means and difs
  ddiff_geo    - obs count double difference
  ddiff_time   - time double difference
  extend_time  - compare 16 and 32 day sequences

  zen_angle   - plot AIRS and CrIS secant by scan angle
  plot_subpt  - AIRS and CrIS 16 day track map
