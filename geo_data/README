geo test data, mainly from airs_geo_list.m and cris_geo_list.m.
These scripts produce paired AIRS and CrIS files containing lists of
latitude, longitude, time, solar zenith and satellite zenith values.
The older files may lack some of the fields, and have the latitude
subsetting weight set to 1.1.   The default value is now 1.0.

airs_sol_d1s1w1.mat and cris_sol_d1s2w1.ma are a typical pair of
these files.  "sol" means the file includes a solar zenith field, w1
that the file was generated with the subsetting weight set to 1, and
d1 and s2 are defined below.  

% specify days of the year
%   dlist = 111 : 126;  % d1, 2016 16 day all good
%   dlist = 118 : 133;  % d2, 2016 16 day all good
%   dlist = 101 : 116;  % d3, 2016 CrIS-only good span 1
%   dlist = 117 : 132;  % d4, 2016 CrIS-only good span 2

% CrIS scan spec
%   iFOR = 15 : 16;       % s1, near nadir
%   iFOR =  1 : 30;       % s2, full scan
%   iFOR = [8 15 16 23];  % s3, near nadir plus half scan
%   iFOR = [8 23];        % s4, half scan only
%   iFOR = 13 : 18;       % s5, expanded nadir
