An "obs list" is a subset of AIRS or CrIS obs, typically a
latitude weighted subset of all obs for 16-days, for a small
subset of channels.

  airs_obs_list - AIRS obs list from channel list
  cris_obs_list - CrIS obs list from window span

  airs_obs_batch - batch wrapper for airs_obs_list
  npp_obs_batch - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list
  n20_obs_batch - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list

Scripts airs_bt_map, cris_bt_map, airs_obs_map, cris_obs_map k
loop on the 16-day sets and build maps, and airs_stat_map loops
on 16-day sets and builds a summary set for further processing.

The old "map_data" directory was created by early map tabulation
version of these functions.  Scripts in obs_source/map_test read
this data.  The old data directories have been renamed

  map_data -> map_16day_mix_v1
  map_data2 -> obs_16day_mix_v1
  airs_rad16 -> obs_16day_airs_c1, obs_16day_airs_c2

the functions in map_test read the older map tabulations

  map_test1 - combine equal area Tb maps, do AIRS and CrIS diff
  map_test2 - combine equal area Tb maps, do CrIS annual diffs
  map_test3 - combine equal area Tb maps, double difference
  map_test4 - combine equal area Tb maps, CrIS npp and n20 diffs
