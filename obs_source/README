An "obs list" is a subset of AIRS or CrIS obs, typically a
latitude weighted subset of all obs for 16-days, for a small
subset of channels.

  airs_obs_list - AIRS obs list from channel list
  cris_obs_list - CrIS obs list from channel list

  airs_obs_batch - batch wrapper for airs_obs_list
  npp_obs_batch  - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list
  n20_obs_batch  - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list

  airs_obs2anmap  - AIRS 16-day obs lists to annual maps
  airs_anmap_stat - annual maps to lat x lon x year stats

  airs_n20_bt_map  - compare AIRS and N20 equal area BT maps
  airs_n20_cnt_map - compare AIRS and NPP equal area obs counts
  npp_n20_bt_map   - compare NPP and N20 equal area BT maps
  npp_n20_cnt_map  - compare NPP and N20 equal area obs counts

Some older data directories were renamed:
  map_data -> map_16day_mix_v1
  map_data2 -> obs_16day_mix_v1
  airs_rad16 -> obs_16day_airs_c1, obs_16day_airs_c2

The older functions in map_test refer to "map_data"
  map_test1 - combine equal area Tb maps, do AIRS and CrIS diff
  map_test2 - combine equal area Tb maps, do CrIS annual diffs
  map_test3 - combine equal area Tb maps, double difference
  map_test4 - combine equal area Tb maps, CrIS npp and n20 diffs
