An "obs list" is a subset of AIRS or CrIS SDR data, typically a
latitude weighted subset of all obs for 16-days, for a small subset
of channels.  A "map table" is an nchan x nlat x nlon x nset table
of maps of 16-day maps mean and variance, usually for a full year.
A "PDF table" is an nbin x nlat x nlon x nset table of 16-day PDF
maps, also usually for a full year (23 16-day sets).


producing obs lists
--------------------
  airs_obs_list - AIRS obs list from channel list
  cris_obs_list - CrIS obs list from channel list

  airs_obs_batch - batch wrapper for airs_obs_list
  npp_obs_batch  - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list
  n20_obs_batch  - batch wrapper for cris_obs_list

obs list to map and PDF tables
-------------------------------
  airs_obs2map_c2  - AIRS 16-day obs lists to single annual map
  airs_obs2tab*    - AIRS 16-day obs lists to annual map tables
  airs_obs2pdf     - AIRS 16-day obs lists to annual PDF tables

stats from map and PDF tables
------------------------------
  airs_trends*     - mapped moving averages and trends
  airs_lat_bands   - mean and std of latitude bands 
  airs_tab_stats*  - mapped mean, std, and diffs
  cris_tab_stats   - mapped mean and std
  airs_pdf_stats*  - mapped PDFs and trends

stats from 16-day obs lists
----------------------------
  airs_n20_bt_map  - compare AIRS and N20 equal area BT maps
  airs_n20_cnt_map - compare AIRS and NPP equal area obs counts
  npp_n20_bt_map   - compare NPP and N20 equal area BT maps
  npp_n20_cnt_map  - compare NPP and N20 equal area obs counts
  npp_n20_fov_map  - FOV breakouts for NPP and N20 equal area maps
  cris_obs2std     - per-channel mean and std from obs lists

older functions
----------------
  airs_weight_fnx - quick look at AIRS weighting functions
  airs_anmap_stat - c1 annual maps to lat x lon x year stats

  some older data directories were renamed:
    map_data -> map_16day_mix_v1
    map_data2 -> obs_16day_mix_v1
    airs_rad16 -> obs_16day_airs_c1, obs_16day_airs_c2

  the older functions in map_test refer to "map_data"
    map_test1 - combine equal area Tb maps, do AIRS and CrIS diff
    map_test2 - combine equal area Tb maps, do CrIS annual diffs
    map_test3 - combine equal area Tb maps, double difference
    map_test4 - combine equal area Tb maps, CrIS npp and n20 diffs
