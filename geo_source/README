AIRS and CrIS geo obs list scripts and functions.  These read AIRS
or CrIS SDR files and tabulate lat, lon, time, and zenith angles for
all obs over a set of days and a selected scan pattern, and do stats
on the resulting obs lists.

  airs_geo_list - build an AIRS geo obs list
  cris_geo_list - build a CrIS geo obs list

  airs_geo_stats  - basic stats from an AIRS obs list
  cris_geo_stats  - basic stats from an CrIS obs list

  obs_map_diff - CrIS minus AIRS equal area obs diffs

  zen_angle   - plot AIRS and CrIS secant by scan angle
  plot_subpt  - AIRS and CrIS 16 day track map

older scripts

  plot_timebin - equal area time means and diffs
  plot_zenbin  - equal area secant means and diffs
  plot_lonbin  - equal area longitude means and difs
  ddiff_geo    - obs count double difference
  ddiff_time   - time double difference
  extend_time  - compare 16 and 32 day sequences
