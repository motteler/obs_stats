equal_area_bins -- takes a list of lat, lon, and obs and returns
  count, mean, and variance for each bin in an equal area grid.
  Bins are determined by dividing equal area latitude bands with
  equally spaced longitude arcs.  This gives trapezoids and pie-
  shaped wedges at the poles.

equal_area_var -- takes a list of lat, lon, and obs values and
  updates incremental mean and variance for each bin in an equal 
  area grid.

equal_area_spherical_bands -- partitions the globe into equal area
  latitude bands

equal_area_map  -- plots a global map from equal area bins

merge_tree  -- combine mean and variance from a list
merge_var   -- combine mean and variance from two sets
