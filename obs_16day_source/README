obs list functions intended to work with 16 day sets.  These
started out as map tabulations but were switched back to list
tabulation, with the mapping done as a separate step.

The old "map_data" directory was created by the map tabulation
version of these functions.  Scripts in obs_16day_source/map_test
read this data.  The old data directories have been renamed

  map_data -> map_16day_mix_v1
  map_data2 -> obs_16day_mix_v1
  airs_rad16 -> obs_16day_airs_c1, obs_16day_airs_c2

  cris_map_list - CrIS obs lists from window span
  airs_map_list - AIRS obs lists from window span
  airs_rad_list - AIRS obs lists from channel set

  airs_map_batch - batch wrapper for airs_map_list
  n20_map_batch - batch wrapper for cris_map_list
  npp_map_batch - batch wrapper for cris_map_list

the functions in map_test read the older map tabulations

  map_test1 - combine equal area Tb maps, do AIRS and CrIS diff
  map_test2 - combine equal area Tb maps, do CrIS annual diffs
  map_test3 - combine equal area Tb maps, double difference
  map_test4 - combine equal area Tb maps, CrIS npp and n20 diffs
